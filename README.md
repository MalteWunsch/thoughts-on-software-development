Thoughts on Software Development
================================

Every once in a while, a software developer thinks they just reached a great insight and want to share it. Or they think
they're onto something, unsure how it will turn out - but they want to discuss their reasoning. Often, developers use a
blog for that.

This one is mine. Feel free to collaborate!


A Github Repository as a Blog?
------------------------------

It seems there are some great blog solutions out there. But I didn't really feel to compare them, choose one, read it's
documentation, install it and possibly tie myself down to it. Sounds like too much work for now, especially when knowing
that sometimes and sadly blogs fall asleep, and that I'm a lazy writer (as my friends would tell you for sure).

Trying to avoid this work (or to phrase it in a more positive way: trying to be agile), I thought of ways to share my
views with a much lower entry threshold. Github came into my mind. It provides a publishing platform (file hosting) with
revision control, the possibility to comment (on a commit) and improve my texts (by opening an issue or a pull request)
and a basic layout (rendering of markdown).

Obviously, it's not perfect, and maybe I'll switch to another system in the future. But I think it's sufficient for now,
and since this blog is directed at programmers, we might even feel a bit comfortable with it. And right now, I think I'm
so damn clever for having avoided work. And now we've come full circle: avoiding work was my very first thought on
getting into software development.
